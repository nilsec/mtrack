Automatic extraction of microtubules in electron microscopy volumes of neural tissue.

The pipeline takes as input 2 probability map stacks in h5 format. One should highlight microtubules that run perpendicular to the imaging plane and the other one those who run under an angle of incidence to the plane (these microtubules appear as line segments in each 2D em image).

Alternatively the probability maps can be generated by the pipeline. For that download Ilastik and interactively train two classifiers (one for perp., one for parallel) on you data set. Specify the path of your ilastik source directory, your raw data and your ilastik project in preprocessing/create_probability_map.py. The probability maps will be saved at the output location you specify.

In solve.py you need to specify your model parameters and the path of both prob maps. The output of the pipeline will be saved in .gt (graph tools) and .nml(xml/knossos) format on the output path you specify.
